        <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>All active electronic devices require a source of constant dc that can be supplied by a battery
            or a dc power supply. The dc power supply converts the North American standard 120 V,
            60 Hz ac voltage available at wall outlets into a constant dc voltage. The dc power supply
            is one of the most common circuits you will find, so it is important to understand how it
            works. The output dc voltage is used to power most electronic circuits, including consumer
            electronics, computers, industrial controllers, and laboratory instrumentation systems and
            equipment. The dc voltage level required depends on the application, but most applications
            require relatively low dc voltages</b></p>

        <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>A basic block diagram of a complete power supply are shown above.
            Generally the ac input line voltage is stepped down to a lower ac voltage with a transformer (although it may be stepped up when higher voltages are needed or there may
            be no transformer at all in rare instances). As you learned in your dc/ac course, a transformer changes ac voltages based on the turns ratio between the primary and secondary.
            If the secondary has more turns than the primary, the output voltage across the secondary
            will be higher and the current will be smaller. If the secondary has fewer turns than the
            primary, the output voltage across the secondary will be lower and the current will be
            higher. The rectifier can be either a half-wave rectifier or a full-wave rectifier.
            The rectifier converts the ac input voltage to a pulsating dc voltage,
            called a half-wave rectified voltage.The filter eliminates the fluctuations in the rectified voltage and produces a relatively smooth dc voltage. The
             The regulator is a circuit that maintains
            a constant dc voltage for variations in the input line voltage or in the load. Regulators
            vary from a single semiconductor device to more complex integrated circuits. The load
            is a circuit or device connected to the output of the power supply and operates from the
            power supply voltage and current.</b></p>
